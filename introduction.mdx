Welcome to the official documentation for the **Vektor Protocol**. 

Vektor is a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) designed to tokenize and distribute enterprise-grade GPU compute cycles. By aggregating idle, high-performance hardware (such as NVIDIA H100 clusters) from Tier III and Tier IV data centers globally, Vektor creates a unified, permissionless inference mesh for AI workloads.

### The Mission

The explosive growth of Artificial Intelligence has created an insatiable demand for raw compute power. Vektor bridges the gap between hardware providers and AI developers by establishing a cryptographic, automated marketplace. 

We allow data centers to monetize their compute density while enabling DeFi participants to capture real-world yield generated by global inference demand.

### Core Protocol Pillars

  <Card title="Protocol-Owned Infrastructure" icon="server">
    Vektor does not rely on consumer-grade hardware. The network is powered by verified, enterprise-grade GPU clusters operating in highly redundant data centers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inference-Weighted Staking" icon="layer-group">
    Staking rewards are not minted arbitrarily. Yield is dynamically calibrated based on real-time global neural network load and inference demand.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Velocity-Gated Autocompounding" icon="rotate">
    Deflationary tokenomics designed for sustainable growth. Logic gates velocity to prevent dilution while accelerating yield accumulation for long-term stakers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="EVM Compatibility" icon="bolt">
    Built for seamless integration. The $VKTR token and its staking contracts operate on highly audited, EVM-compatible infrastructure.

### Target Audience

This documentation is designed for two primary stakeholders within the Vektor ecosystem:
1. **Node Operators:** Enterprise data centers and institutions looking to provision their GPU clusters to the network.
2. **DeFi Participants:** Users looking to stake `$VKTR` to capture infrastructure-backed yield.
